# QualiTea
software development group project

The tea industry plays a significant role in the Sri Lankan economy in terms of foreign exchange earnings and providing employment opportunities. With the fast-growing of Deep Learning, the intelligent and labour-free authentication of the tea quality, becomes a substantially demanded yet unexplored area, with two key problems yet to be solved: which are sampling of tea data, with a fast and environmentally friendly approach, and distinguishment of tea, in terms of building an accurate tea classifier. The purpose of this study is to analyse Sri Lankaâ€™s tea to determine the grade and predict the price With a deep learning based approach to image classification, replacing  the traditional image classification models and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process the images to give a more accurate output.
